# LANL-Earthquake-predict--Kaggle
Forecasting earthquakes is one of the most important problems in Earth science because of their devastating consequences. Current scientific studies related to
earthquake forecasting focus on three key points: when the event will occur, where it will occur, and how large it will be.

I have used the CatBoost Model and the SVM model in this project.
